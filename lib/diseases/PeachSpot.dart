Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections.\n\n2. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit.\n\n3. Early defoliated trees are reduced in vigor and winter hardiness. Fruit symptoms of bacterial spot may be confused with peach scab, caused by the fungus Cladosporium carpophyllium, however scab spots are more circular, have a dark brown/greenish, fuzzy appearance, and do not pit the fruit surface, although skin cracking can occur.\n\n4. Scab does not cause leaf symptoms but can cause spots on twigs. Initial fruit spots of bacterial spot may be superficial but develop into craters. Leaf symptoms of bacterial spot on peaches and nectarines are generally dark, small lesions, often clustered at the leaf tip where water collects during dews and rain. Leaf tissue around lesions can turn yellow.',

As temperatures rise over 65 degrees F. (18 C.) and budding begins, the bacteria begin to multiply.\n\n2. They are spread from cankers via dripping dew, rain splashing or wind. Severe fruit infections occur most frequently when there is ample rainfall combined with high humidity.\n\n3. The infection is also most severe when the trees are planted in light, sandy soil and/or if trees are stressed. Bacterial spot symptoms on leaves generally are not seen until after bloom but onset can occur earlier if conditions are highly favorable.\n\n4. Fruit are very susceptible when exposed after shuck split and the susceptibility goes down after pit hardening in mid- to late June.',

Protect trees from strong winds by establishing shelter belt trees on the windward side of the orchard. Another strategy is to establish sod strips between trees and to use gravel or other dust-suppressing methods on nearby dirt roads. Removal of gummy-blackened branch tips typical of bacterial spot during spring pruning may help somewhat to reduce inoculum levels. Fertilize where needed to maintain vigorous but not excessive shoot growth.',

Initial treatments focus on suppression of leaf infection and later on protection of fruit as they emerge from the shuck.\n\n2. Bactericide treatment may not be sufficient to eliminate symptoms under conditions very favorable for disease development. Compounds available for use on peach and nectarine for bacterial spot include copper, oxytetracycline (Mycoshield and generic equivalents), and syllit+captan; however, repeated applications are typically necessary for even minimal disease control.\n\n3. Oxytetracycline is generally considered the most effective compound and the least prone to phytotoxicity problems (damage to plant tissue), but also perhaps most likely to lose effectiveness with the appearance of bacterial strains with resistance.',
